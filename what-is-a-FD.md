# What is a front-end developer?

A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web technologies (i.e. HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript) which run on the web platform or act as compilation input for non-web platform environments.

Typically, a developer enters into the field of front-end development by developing for some type of [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser), native webview, or [headless browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser) running on desktops/laptops, tablets, or phones. Below are some examples of each.

Web Browers: [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/), [Internet Explorer](http://dev.modern.ie/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/)

Native WebViews: [NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js), [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)

Headless Browsers: [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), [trifleJS](http://triflejs.org/)

Eventually, what is learned from web browser development can then be used to develop code for enviorments that are not fueled by a browser engine. Some examples of these enviorments would be [[NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) or [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)).
