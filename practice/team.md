# Front-end on a team

A front-end developer is typically one player on a team that designs and develops web sites, web applications, or native applications running on web technologies. 

A bare bones team for building professional sites or software on the web will contain minimally the following roles.

* Visual Designer
* UI/Interaction Designer
* Front-end Developer
* Back-end Developer

The roles are order according to overlapping skills. A front-end developer will typically have a good handle on UI/Interaction design as well as back-end development. It is not uncommon for team members to fill more than one role by taking on the responsibilities of an over-lapping role.

It is assumed that the team is being directed by a project lead of some sorts (i.e. stakeholder, project manager, product owner etc...)

A larger team might include the following roles not shown above:

* Visual Designers
* UI/Interaction Designer
* **SEO strategist**
* Front-end Developer
* **DevOps Engineers**
* Back-end Developer
* **Database Administrator**
* **QA Engineer / Testers**
