# Front-end on a team

A front-end developer is typically one player on a team that developers web sites or web applications. 

A bare bones team for building professional sites or software on the web will contain minimally the following roles.

* Visual Designer
* UI/Interaction Designer
* Front-end Developer
* Back-end Developer
* Lead/stakeholder (project/product owner/leader i.e. a decision maker/requester)

The roles are order according to overlapping skills. A front-end developer will typically have a good handle on UI/Interaction design as well as back-end development. It is not uncommon for team members to fill more than one role by taking on the responsibilities of an over-lapping role.

Additional roles include:

* Database Administrator
* DevOps Engineers
* QA Engineer
* Testers
* Content creators
* SEO strategist
