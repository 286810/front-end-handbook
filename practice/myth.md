# Do all designers & developers myth

The roles required to design and develop a web solution require a deep skill set and vast experience in the area of visual design, interaction design, front-end development, and back-end development. Any person who can fill one or more of these 4 roles at a professional level is a rare exception to the rule.

Pragmatically you should seek to be, or seek to hire an expert in one of these roles. Those who claim to operate at an expert level at one or more of these roles are exceptional, rare, and more than likely mythical.
