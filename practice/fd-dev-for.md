# Front-end developers develop for...

A front-end developer typically uses front-end technologies to create HTML, CSS, and JS that run in a browser on one of the following operating systems:

* Windows
* Windows Phone
* OSX
* iOS
* Android
* Ubuntu (or some flavor of )
* Chromium

These operating systems typically run on one or more of the following devices:

* Desktop computer
* Laptop / Netbook computer
* Mobile phone
* Tablet
* TV
* Watch
* Things (i.e. anything you can imagine, car, fridge etc..)

Generally speaking, front-end technologies can run on the aforementioned mentioned operating systems and devices using the following run time scenarios:

* A web browser (e.g. [Chrome, IE, Safari, Firefox](http://outdatedbrowser.com/en)) running from OS
* A headless browser (e.g. phantomJS) driven from a CLI running on OS
* A WebView/browser embedded within a native application as a runtime with bridged to native API's. UI is all web based. (e.g. Apache Cordova, NW.js, Electron)
* A native application built from web tech that is interpreted at runtime with a bridge to native API's. UI is native based. (e.g. NativeScript, React Native)
