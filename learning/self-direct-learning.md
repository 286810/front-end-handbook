# Self directed learning

This section focuses on free and paid resources that an individual can use to direct their own learning process as a front-end developer.

The resources include free material and paid material (indicated with a [$]).

The author believes that anyone with the right determination and dedication can teach themselves how to be a front-end developer. All that is required is a computer connected to the web and possibly some cash for books as well as an account on [front-End Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) (39$ a month) and [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) (starting at 29$ a month).
