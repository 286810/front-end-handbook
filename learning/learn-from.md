# Front-end developers to learn from

The notion that you should follow an individual to learn about front-end development is slowly becoming pointless. The practice of front-end development is generating enough content that you can follow the community/leaders by simply following the "news" (via Newsletters, News, Books, ScreenCasts & Podcasts). 

In short, follow information to a human not just a human.
