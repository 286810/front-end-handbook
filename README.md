Front-end Developer Handbook

***

This is a guide that anyone could use to learn about the practice of front-end development. It broadly outlines and discusses the practice of front-end engineering. How to learn it and what tools are used when practicing it.

It is specifically written with the intention of being a professional resource for potential and currently practicing front-end developers to equip themselves with relevant/opinionated learning resources and tools. Secondarily, it could be used be managers, instructors, and head hunters to gain insights into the practice of front-end development.
