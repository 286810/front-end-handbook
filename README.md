# Front-end Developer Handbook

This is a guide that anyone could use to learn about the practice of front-end development. It broadly outlines and discusses the practice of front-end engineering. How to learn it. And what tools are used when practicing it.

It is specifically written with the intention of being a professional resource for potential and currently practicing front-end developers to equip themselves with relevant/opinionated learning resources and tools. Secondarily, it could be used by managers, instructors, and head hunters to gain insights into the practice of front-end development.

The content of the handbook favors web technologies (HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript) and those solutions that are directly built on top of these technologies. The materials referenced and discussed in the book are either best in class or the current offering to a problem. The book should not be consider a comprehensive outline of every and all resources available to a front-end developer. The value of the book is tied up in a terse, focused, and timely curation of just enough information so as not to overwhelm anyone on any one particular topic.

The handbook is divided into three parts. 

Part I. Practice
---
These chapters discuss the practice of front-end engineering.

Part II: Learning
---
These chapters identify self-directed and direct resources for learning to become a front-end developer as well as mastering the practice.

Part III: Tools
---
These chapters briefly explain and identify the tools of the trade.
